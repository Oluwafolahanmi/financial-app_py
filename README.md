This Python program simulates a mobile banking application, guiding users through account creation, login, and transaction processes. It begins with an introduction, allowing users to select a bank and create an account with personal information. After logging in, users can perform various transactions such as deposits, transfers, and utility payments. The program validates inputs and updates account balances accordingly, offering a seamless user experience. Additionally, it loops to allow users to perform multiple transactions before choosing to exit.
